...and that's a wrap for this year! Thanks for coming along, and taking part!

We're already thinking about next year's event, which will happen in the
second semester of 2020/2021.

Can't wait that long? We meet every week to hack things and practice for
other CTFs that we take part in; for more information check out
<https://afnom.net>.

If you've got questions, you can email us at <ctf@afnom.net>.
